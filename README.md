# You-ll_know_JaredB_Very_Soon

## This is my first attempt to produce starter code for a project to create a Web Application portfolio for myself. This will give me a good start to begin providing professional web application companies a browse at my past and current employment and experience. It provides a little introduction to me, my work experience and current experience and how to contact me.

### Credits go out to UC Berkley for their added help including and not limited to Robbert and Michael. Also, my brother in law, Heber Cooke, for opening my mind to CSS selectors and their use for better page deployment.
